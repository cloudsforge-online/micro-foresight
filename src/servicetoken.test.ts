/**
 * **THE FIFTEEN-SECOND JOB AND THE TEN-MINUTE TOKEN, DRIVEN PAST THE EXPIRY.**
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * ## The defect
 *
 * `FORESIGHT_SERVICE_TOKEN` held a token that lives **600 seconds** (`identity/src/tokens.ts:28`).
 * The composition root read it once, at import — `const token = () => env.serviceToken` — and handed
 * that to all five upstream clients. This service's custody calls come from **leased background
 * jobs**: `market.deploy` provisions a per-market deployer address and signs a contract creation,
 * and `recurringJobs` re-arms its sweep every **15 seconds**, for ever. So it authenticated once per
 * bootstrap and every job from minute ten onwards presented a dead token.
 *
 * **And the log would have named the wrong service.** `driveDeploy` maps a custody 401 to
 * `CustodySignRefusedError` or `CustodyUnavailableError`, which read as "custody said no" and
 * "custody is down". Neither is true; the container's own credential had expired. That
 * misattribution is the same one that sent operators after the indexer while `micro-ledger` froze
 * EMBER, and it is the real cost here.
 *
 * ## Why every other test in this repository is blind to it
 *
 * They build their own client and use it a millisecond later. **A test that mints a token and
 * immediately uses it proves nothing about this defect** — the token is never asked to survive its
 * own lifetime, and at the speed of a test a hard-coded string and a live credential are
 * indistinguishable. `deploy.test.ts` beside this file drives the whole deploy loop and is green
 * with a `fakeCustody` that never looks at a header. That is the property this file removes: below,
 * the clock moves **ELEVEN MINUTES** past a token the process already holds, that token is shown to
 * be refused **by a real `Verifier`**, and only then is the leased job run again.
 *
 * ## The assertion that stops this file being green for the wrong reason
 *
 * `authorizedFetch` re-mints and replays on a 401. So a completely broken refresh SCHEDULE would
 * still end in a successful deploy — one 401, one re-mint, one replay — and a test that only checked
 * the outcome would pass over it. The post-expiry case therefore asserts **zero 401s**: the token
 * must have been refreshed on schedule, before it was ever presented. `EIGHT HOURS` then runs the
 * job thirty-two times across a whole shift and holds the same bar.
 *
 * ## What is real here, and what is not
 *
 *   * **Real**: `buildUpstreams` (the wiring under test), `ServiceTokenProvider`, `HttpClient`,
 *     `httpCustodyClient`, `Verifier` and jose's own expiry arithmetic, `JobQueue` claiming a real
 *     row `for update skip locked`, `JobRunner`, `jobs.ts`'s real `market.deploy` handler,
 *     `driveDeploy`, and a real Postgres with this service's migrations live. The markets below are
 *     read back out of the database, not out of a return value.
 *   * **Simulated**: the clock, and the two peers' transports. `mock.timers` moves `Date` only, so
 *     jose decides expiry from the same instant the provider schedules against — nothing here
 *     decides expiry by hand, which is how a test ends up agreeing with the code it is checking.
 *
 * `T0` is deliberately in the past. The clock is mocked and Postgres's is not, and `JobQueue`
 * computes `run_at` in JS while the claim query compares it against the database's `now()`. A `T0`
 * at "today" would put every enqueue eleven minutes into the database's future at exactly the moment
 * the test cares about, and the runner would claim nothing — a green suite proving nothing ran.
 *
 * ## Going through `buildUpstreams` is the whole point
 *
 * A test that constructs its own `ServiceTokenProvider` and its own `httpCustodyClient` proves the
 * provider works, which is `@cloudsforge/auth`'s job. It proves nothing about whether THIS SERVICE
 * uses it, and "this service does not use it" was the defect. Reverting `upstreams.ts` to
 * `token: () => env.serviceToken` turns the first two tests below red — and `BASELINE` models that
 * exact old seam, against the same fixtures, so this file also demonstrates the failure it fixes.
