/**
 * The house seed — docs/ecosystem/21 §5, phase 1.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **THE HOUSE IS A BETTOR WITH A PUBLISHED ADDRESS. THIS SERVICE NEVER TOUCHES THE MONEY.**
 *
 * That is not a shortcut; it is the only design the estate admits, and it is the better one:
 *
 *   1. **Custody cannot sign a stake.** `stake(uint8)` is a value-bearing contract CALL, and
 *      custody's three EVM shapes are creation (value must be zero —
 *      `custody/src/signing.ts:210-227` `assertCreation`), plain value transfer (data must be
 *      empty — `:231-260` `assertTransfer`), and sweep. `foresight/src/custodyclient.ts:24-28`
 *      already records that no purpose's shape is "call a contract" — it is why the oracle acts
 *      through a constructor (`ForesightResolver`). A resolver-style seeder contract would make
 *      the CONTRACT the staker, and its winnings would strand at a keyless address. So the seed
 *      is staked by the platform's own wallet, from `FORESIGHT_HOUSE_ADDRESS` — a published,
 *      disclosed address, funded like the miners' coinbases are (21 §3) — through the very same
 *      `stake(uint8)` every bettor uses.
 *
 *   2. **Settlement composes because nothing forks.** The house address is an ordinary staker:
 *      its position is mirrored by `mirror.ts` like anyone's, the contract's `payoutOf` counts it
 *      like anyone's, and after resolution its winnings come back through `claim()`/`claimFor()`
 *      (`src/contracts/ForesightMarket.sol:431-437`) — `claimFor` exists precisely so a batching
 *      job can push a payout to a staker. From the house address the EMBER returns to the
 *      engagement account the way 21 §3 says everything does: through the front door — deposit,
 *      indexer confirmation, conversion — "like any bettor's", literally.
 *
 *   3. **What this table adds is the COMMITMENT.** The chain cannot say "this stake was the
 *      disclosed, opinion-free seed and not the platform trading". This table can, and its
 *      constraints make the claim checkable: symmetric by CHECK, plannable only before open,
 *      recorded staked only in the opening transaction with the market's exact open timestamp,
 *      immutable afterwards. Opening a seeded market is REFUSED until the mirror shows the exact
 *      symmetric position the plan promises — so 'open with a seed' means 'the house money is
 *      already in the pool', never 'we intend it to be'.
 *
 * **The caps** (21 §7.3) bind twice: the hard ceilings are CHECK/trigger facts in migration 8
 * (the same numbers admin-api CHECKs on the policy — `admin-api/src/migrations.ts` version 8),
 * and the operator-tunable caps below them bind at approval time against admin-api's live policy
 * (`src/adminapiclient.ts`), fail-closed. All seed numbers are PER OUTCOME SIDE; the symmetric
 * total is twice the number.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
