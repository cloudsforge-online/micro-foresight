/**
 * micro-admin-api's engagement policy, as this service reads it at market approval.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **WHY THE SEED SIZES RIDE THE APPROVAL AND THE CAPS LIVE SOMEWHERE ELSE.**
 *
 * This service consumes operator configuration two ways today: environment variables (env.ts)
 * and its own operator routes. Neither can hold the engagement caps — docs/ecosystem/21 §4 puts
 * them in admin-api's `engagement_policies` because admin-api owns cross-service operator state,
 * and §8 is blunt that nothing may move before those caps exist. So the DECISION, recorded:
 *
 *   * The seed size rides `POST /markets/:id/approve`'s payload (`houseSeedPerOutcomeWei`) — the
 *     approving operator chooses it per market, inside the caps.
 *   * At approval time it is validated against admin-api's LIVE policy through this client —
 *     per-market size and the day's running total against the per-day size.
 *   * **FAIL CLOSED, like the stake-intent policy gate** (`policyclient.ts`): if admin-api
 *     cannot be reached, approval WITH a seed refuses and says retry; approval WITHOUT a seed is
 *     untouched, because an unreachable operator surface must not stop ordinary markets.
 *   * If `ADMIN_API_URL` is unset, seeding is refused outright — unconfigured is a supported
 *     mode (the notify-SMTP discipline), and its meaning here is "this deployment has no
 *     engagement programme", which is exactly true.
 *   * The HARD ceilings do not depend on any of this: they are CHECK/trigger facts in BOTH
 *     schemas (migration 8 here, migration 8 there, same numbers), so an unreachable admin-api
 *     can never be leveraged into an unbounded seed.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * ## Route, verified
 *
 * `GET /v1/engagement/policies` — `admin-api/src/server.ts:956`. Its guard is `requireReader`
 * (`admin-api/src/server.ts:481`): a SERVICE token must hold the exact scope `admin:read` —
 * admin-api matches scopes exactly, §3.3h, so `admin:*` will not do. The scope is registered in
 * `contracts/packages/auth` ('admin:read', citing the gate). The response carries `policies`
 * (per-service rows) and `ceilings`.
