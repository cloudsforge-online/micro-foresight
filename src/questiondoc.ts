/**
 * The market document, and the hash of it that goes on chain.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **THE RESOLUTION SOURCE IS NAMED AT OPEN, AND THE CHAIN REMEMBERS THAT IT WAS.**
 *
 * 19-new-products.md §2.3.5 calls this "resolution honesty is structural", and structural is the
 * operative word: a promise that the operator will not shop for a friendlier source at resolution
 * time is worth nothing, and a database column recording the source is worth only as much as the
 * database's write history. So the whole document — question, criteria, source, close time, dispute
 * window — is serialised canonically here, hashed, and handed to the market's constructor as
 * `questionHash`. It is immutable from the moment the market exists.
 *
 * A bettor can therefore check, without asking anybody, that the criteria on the public page are
 * the criteria the market was deployed with. An operator who edited them afterwards would produce a
 * page whose hash does not match a contract nobody can change.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * ## Canonical, which is the entire difficulty
 *
 * Two serialisations of one document that differ by a space produce two hashes, and the second one
 * makes the market page look forged. So the encoding here is deliberately rigid and deliberately
 * NOT `JSON.stringify` of an object literal: field order is fixed by the code rather than by
 * insertion order, every value is length-prefixed so that no pair of adjacent fields can be
 * confused with another pair (the classic concatenation ambiguity — `"ab"+"c"` and `"a"+"bc"`), and
 * strings are UTF-8 with no normalisation surprises left implicit.
