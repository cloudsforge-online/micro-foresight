/**
 * The idea queue: what a machine proposed, and what a person did about it.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **NOTHING A MODEL PRODUCES CAN OPEN A MARKET.**
 *
 * 19-new-products.md §2.3.3 states why, and the reason is not squeamishness about language models:
 * a market is a financial instrument and its resolution criteria are a contract with strangers.
 * Those get authored by someone accountable. A model that writes "will the price of X exceed Y"
 * without saying which venue, at which timestamp, in which currency, has written a question that
 * cannot be settled — and the person who discovers that is a bettor who has already staked.
 *
 * So the pipeline's output is a PROPOSAL. An operator approves, edits, or discards it, and the
 * approval is what a market is built from. This file is the proposal half; `markets.ts` is the
 * other half, and `migrations.ts` version 5 is the constraint that holds when both are wrong.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * ## Provenance is stored because it is shown
 *
 * Query, sources, model id, prompt hash, timestamp — all five, on the row. Not for an audit nobody
 * reads: the sources are carried through to the PUBLIC market page, so a bettor can see why the
 * market exists and check the reasoning for themselves. A proposal whose provenance is missing is
 * not reviewable, and the `ideas_model_has_provenance` constraint means it cannot be stored.
