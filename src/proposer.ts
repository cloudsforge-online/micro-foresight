/**
 * The idea pipeline's outside world: a web search, and a model that drafts questions.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **UNCONFIGURED IS A SUPPORTED MODE.**
 *
 * Same discipline as `micro-notify`'s SMTP: a deployment with no search endpoint and no model
 * endpoint is a working deployment. The pipeline runs, records that it had nothing to propose, and
 * the operator queue stays empty. It does not crash, it does not retry into a dead-letter, and it
 * does not log an error every six hours for a thing nobody has configured yet.
 *
 * The reason this matters more here than for email: the AI is the least essential part of this
 * product and the most likely to be unavailable. An operator can write a market question by hand —
 * `POST /ideas` with `origin: 'operator'` is the same path — and every market this platform ever
 * runs could be authored that way. The pipeline is a convenience that suggests; a service that fell
 * over when its suggester was absent would have the dependency exactly backwards.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * ## One interface, and the adapter behind it is replaceable
 *
 * There is no vendor name in this file and no vendor SDK in `package.json`. What the pipeline needs
 * is: give me some recent public material about these topics, and turn it into candidate questions
 * with resolution criteria. Both are HTTP calls to endpoints named in the environment, with the
 * request and response shapes below. A deployment points them at whatever it uses.
 *
 * ## What comes back is DATA, not instructions
 *
 * The text a search returns and the text a model returns are untrusted input. They are stored,
 * shown to an operator and never executed, never used to select a code path, and never allowed to
 * name a category that is not in the allowlist — `validateProposal` runs on every candidate before
 * it is stored, and a candidate that fails is dropped with a counted reason rather than repaired.
 * A model that returns `{"category": "anything"}` produces no row.
