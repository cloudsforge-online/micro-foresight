/**
 * THE SEED BATCH, CHECKED AGAINST THE RULES THIS SERVICE ENFORCES ON THE WIRE.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * `seed/questions-2026h2.mjs` and `seed/questions-short-202608.mjs` are research, and research is
 * prose until something checks it. Both are checked here, by the same predicates, from one
 * `BATCHES` list — see its definition for why that is a list and not two copies of this file. Every
 * field in one of those entries is validated by `createDraft` and by `server.ts`'s body parsing —
 * a bad category is a 400 `bad_category`, a source kind the category does not permit is a 400
 * `bad_source_kind`, a close time in the past is a 400 `bad_close_time`, a fee above 1,000bps is a
 * 400 `bad_fee`, a dispute window above 30 days is a `BadRequestError`. Without this file every one
 * of those is discovered by an operator, mid-run, against a live estate, with some markets already
 * created and some not — which is the worst possible place to find a typo, because the seeder is
 * check-then-create and a partial batch has to be reasoned about by hand.
 *
 * So the assertions below are not a restatement of the data. They are the SAME predicates the
 * service applies, run against the data at build time: `isCategory` and `isSourceKindFor` are
 * imported from `categories.ts` rather than re-listed, and the numeric bounds are written as the
 * literals `server.ts` uses with a comment naming the line. When the allowlist changes, this file
 * fails for the questions the change invalidates.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * ## What is deliberately NOT checked here
 *
 * **Whether a question is one the platform should run.** `categories.ts` argues at length that the
 * refusals must not be implemented as a text filter — "a regular expression that looks for the word
 * 'die' would pass 'will X still be with us in June' and would fail a market about a protocol being
 * deprecated" — and that the enforcement is the three-category allowlist plus a person approving.
 * A scan here for the shape of a personal name would be exactly the filter that file refuses, and
 * it would be worse than useless: it would read as a check, so the approver would trust it.
 *
 * **Whether a threshold is well chosen.** `observed` records the reading that justified it, and
 * this file checks that the reading is THERE and dated. Whether 8,000 was the right number for the
 * S&P 500 is a judgement, and a judgement is what the approval queue is for.
 *
 * **Whether the batch duplicates the estate's opening nine.** Those live in `micro-deploy` and this
 * repository does not depend on it. Copying the nine question texts here to diff against would
 * create a second copy that drifts, and a stale copy that reports "no duplicates" is worse than no
 * check. That comparison was done by hand when the batch was written and the three candidates it
 * eliminated are named in the data file's header, which is where a reviewer will look.
