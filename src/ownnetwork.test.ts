/**
 * Which estate this pod is, and why every per-network map in `index.ts` has to be keyed by it.
 *
 * foresight was the first service to crash on getting this wrong, so the regression lives here.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHAT HAPPENED
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The composition root built its maps with the literal:
 *
 *     const planes = [{ network: 'mainnet' as const, pool: sql, queue: queueFor(sql) }, …]
 *
 * One image, one codebase, two deployments. The testnet pod ran that same line and registered its
 * testnet queue under the name `mainnet`. Then a request arrived stamped `CF-Network: testnet`,
 * `planeFor('testnet')` found nothing, and it threw — correctly, and into a request listener, where
 * an uncaught throw is not a 500 but a process exit.
 *
 * Ready, first request, dead, restart, dead. Three testnet services.
 *
 * The unit tests all passed throughout, and they pass on the broken code today, because they assert
 * that `planeFor` throws for an unheld network — which it did, perfectly. Nothing asserted which
 * networks a testnet pod HOLDS. That gap is what this file closes.
