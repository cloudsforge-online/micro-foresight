/**
 * The market registry and its lifecycle.
 *
 *     draft → approved → open → closed → resolved → settled
 *                ↘         ↘        ↘         ↘
 *                          void  ←────────────┘
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE STATE MACHINE IS THE FIRST OF TWO ENFORCEMENTS, NOT THE ONLY ONE.
 *
 * `markets_unapproved_never_opens` in `migrations.ts` version 5 says the same thing in the
 * database. That is not belt and braces for its own sake — it is the beacon discipline
 * (`micro-beacon`, `gate_decisions_indeterminate_never_promotes`), and the division of labour is
 * exact:
 *
 *   * The state machine here is what gives a caller a 409 with a sentence they can act on.
 *   * The constraint is what holds when a future refactor adds a second write path, when a
 *     migration is run by hand, and when an operator fixes something with `psql` at 3am.
 *
 * A rule that exists in only one of those two places is a rule that will be broken by the other.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * ## Why `void` is reachable from everywhere
 *
 * Because the reasons to void are not confined to one phase. A named source that has disappeared
 * is discovered at resolution; a category mistake is discovered while the market is open; a
 * question that turns out to be ambiguous is discovered by the first person who reads it properly.
 * In every case the honest action is the same and it is available: refund, whole, no fee. What is
 * NOT available is voiding a market that has already been settled — the money has gone, and a
 * status change afterwards would be a lie about a payment that happened.
