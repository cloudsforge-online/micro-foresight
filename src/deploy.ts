/**
 * Deploying a market contract, as background work.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **THE DEPLOY IS NOT IN THE REQUEST.** `POST /markets/:id/deploy` answers 202 with a status URL;
 * everything below runs under a lease, in a job, on whichever replica claims it. That is
 * `micro-mint`'s pattern and it is inherited wholesale, because the failure it prevents is the same
 * one and is worse here: mint's bad landing costs a duplicate token and some gas, and this one
 * would leave two market contracts for one question with stakers split between the pools.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * ## The sequence, and why each step must precede the next
 *
 *     claim → provision deployer → check funding → PREPARE (sign) → COMMIT bytes → broadcast →
 *     record broadcast → poll outcome
 *
 * A crash before the commit has broadcast nothing: the signature is discarded unbroadcast, no gas
 * was spent, and the next tick rebuilds from a fresh nonce read. A crash after the commit and
 * before the send leaves bytes with no `broadcast_at`, and the next tick RESUMES AT BROADCAST with
 * the identical bytes — a re-send of one transaction, never a second one. A crash after the send is
 * covered because the hash was written WITH the bytes, so the row can be polled to a terminal state
 * without anything being sent again.
 *
 * **That is the whole answer to "a lost broadcast response must not produce two contracts."** The
 * hash is derivable before the send (`evm.ts`'s `evmTxHash`), so there is no window in which a
 * transaction exists and its id does not. `markets_deploy_in_flight_uniq` and
 * `markets_deploy_tx_hash_uniq` are the database saying the same thing for the case where the lease
 * has already failed — `micro-settlement`'s discipline, applied to the resource that is genuinely
 * contended here.
 *
 * ## Why the market's address is known before it exists
 *
 * `createAddress(deployer, nonce)` is a total function of two values this service holds, so the
 * contract address is committed with the bytes and checked against the receipt when one arrives. A
 * derived address that disagrees with the mined one means the nonce moved under us, and that is the
 * one condition under which a deploy must be FAILED rather than confirmed — the contract at the
 * address we published is not ours.
