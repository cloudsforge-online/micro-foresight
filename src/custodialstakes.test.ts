/**
 * The custodial stake, against a real database and a real socket.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE FOUR THAT MATTER MOST, and each is proved by mutation rather than by reading:
 *
 *   * **A REFUND RETURNS WHAT WAS TAKEN.** Not today's rate, not a rate re-inverted. The exact
 *     integer on the row, in the asset it arrived in.
 *   * **A RETRY REPLAYS, IT DOES NOT TAKE A SECOND STAKE.** The failure that charges a stranger
 *     twice is a retry after a lost response, and nobody reproduces it by hand.
 *   * **AN UNREADABLE RATE REFUSES.** No row, no ledger entry, no position — a stake priced at a
 *     guess is a guess at how much of somebody's money to take.
 *   * **A LEDGER REFUSAL LEAVES NOTHING BEHIND.** The ledger looked and said no, so the stake did
 *     not happen and its idempotency key must not stay claimed — otherwise the retry replays a
 *     position nobody holds.
