/**
 * The policy service, as this service uses it.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **FAIL CLOSED. STAKING IS NOT LISTING.**
 *
 * `micro-market` fails OPEN on this gate and is right to: a policy outage that stopped every seller
 * listing would shut the marketplace by somebody else's incident, and an unmoderated listing can be
 * taken down afterwards. Neither half of that argument survives here.
 *
 * A stake is a transfer of EMBER into a contract with no undo. Once the wallet has broadcast it,
 * there is no take-down, no reversal and no moderation queue — the money is in the pool and the
 * pool pays out by arithmetic. So the shape of this gate is `wallet.withdrawal`'s, not
 * `market.listing.create`'s: if policy cannot be reached, this service refuses to hand out a stake
 * intent, and the person is told to try again shortly. The cost of that is a few minutes of
 * inconvenience; the cost of the other choice is a frozen account's owner staking their way past a
 * freeze while the service that would have stopped them is down.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * ## What "refuses" actually stops, stated honestly
 *
 * **It stops this service issuing the intent, not the chain accepting the stake.** Anybody holding
 * EMBER and the market's address can call `stake()` directly with a wallet, and nothing here — or
 * anywhere — can prevent that. That is a property of building on a public chain and it should be
 * said out loud rather than papered over: this gate governs the platform's own front door, which is
 * the route essentially every user takes, and it makes the freeze meaningful for them. A user
 * determined to route around their own freeze by hand-crafting a transaction was never going to be
 * stopped by an HTTP call.
 *
 * ## Routes, verified
 *
 * `POST /decisions` — `micro-policy/src/server.ts:338`. Note it is UNPREFIXED. Policy serves
 * `/decisions`, `/decisions/:id`, `/subjects/:subject/decisions`, `/rules`, `/freezes` and the
 * three health endpoints, and nothing under `/v1` at all.
 *
 * The scope is `policy:decide` (`policy/src/server.ts:83`), and a user token can never reach the
 * route — `requireScope` is false for anything that is not a service, deliberately, because
 * deciding on your own behalf is not a thing policy offers.
