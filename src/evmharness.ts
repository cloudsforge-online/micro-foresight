/**
 * An EVM, for testing the contract.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHY THERE IS AN EVM IN THIS REPOSITORY AT ALL, AND WHY IT IS ONE DEPENDENCY.
 *
 * The invariants that matter here are statements about EXECUTED BYTECODE. "A pool sums exactly",
 * "a second claim reverts", "resolution before close is impossible", "only the oracle resolves" —
 * none of those can be checked by reading an ABI or hashing a source file. They need something that
 * runs the code.
 *
 * The alternatives were weighed and are worse:
 *
 *   * **Hardhat or Foundry.** Each brings a whole toolchain and a second build system into a
 *     repository whose entire compile step is one 90-line script and one exact-pinned `solc`. The
 *     estate's rule is that a service has one build; this would give it two.
 *   * **A real Hearth node.** `micro-indexer` does exactly this and is right to — but its Hearth
 *     test SKIPS when no node is reachable (`indexer/src/hearth.test.ts:59`), and a suite whose
 *     contract invariants skip on the one machine that matters is a suite that proves nothing. CI
 *     has no chain.
 *   * **Not testing the contract.** Not available. It holds other people's money.
 *
 * So: `@ethereumjs/evm`, a devDependency, used only here. It executes the same committed bytecode
 * `deploy.ts` sends to custody — `FORESIGHTMARKET_BYTECODE` from `generated.ts`, the artefact CI
 * recompiles and diffs — so what the tests run is what the chain would run.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * ## What it does NOT prove, said plainly
 *
 * That Hearth's own EVM behaves identically. It is an Ethereum-compatible chain and the contract is
 * compiled for `paris` precisely to stay inside what it implements, but "compatible" is a claim
 * about a node this harness does not run. The integration that would close that gap is a deploy to
 * the Hearth testnet, which belongs in a deployment rehearsal rather than in a unit suite.
