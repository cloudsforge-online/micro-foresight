/**
 * Configuration, validated at import.
 *
 * Rule 9 of docs/ecosystem/03 §2 — "a repo declares the variables it needs; the deploy provides
 * exactly those" — is a property of this file. Every variable this service reads is named here and
 * nowhere else, so the deploy manifest can be derived from it and `env_file: .env` fan-out (which
 * hands every container the whole estate's secrets) has nothing to justify it.
 *
 * Two behaviours are copied deliberately from custody:
 *
 *   1. **A missing variable names itself.** `undefined` propagating into a connection string
 *      surfaces four layers later as an unreadable driver error.
 *   2. **A known placeholder is refused outright.** A default secret in source is not convenient,
 *      it is catastrophic, and a placeholder that boots is a placeholder that reaches production.
 *
 * ## The two fail-closed defaults
 *
 * `FORESIGHT_MAINNET_ENABLED` is false, so a misconfigured deployment cannot put a market holding
 * real EMBER on a mainnet nobody authorised. And `FORESIGHT_PROPOSER_*` is unset by default, which
 * is a SUPPORTED MODE rather than an error: the idea pipeline records "no proposals" and the
 * operator queue stays empty. Same discipline as `micro-notify`'s unconfigured SMTP — an external
 * dependency nobody has wired yet must degrade, not crash.

   * `FORESIGHT_SERVICE_TOKEN` holds a token that lives **600 seconds** (`identity/src/tokens.ts:28`)
   * and `index.ts` read it once, at import: `const token = () => env.serviceToken`, handed verbatim
   * to all five `HttpClient`s. So this service authenticated to custody, the indexer, the ledger,
   * policy and admin-api **exactly once per bootstrap** and never again.
   *
   * tessera and emberkin share the shape and mostly get away with it, because their upstream calls
   * happen on request paths that a bootstrap outruns. **This service's custody calls come from
   * LEASED BACKGROUND JOBS** — `market.deploy` and `resolution.post` — which is precisely the shape
   * that froze EMBER reconciliation for hours through `micro-ledger`: a 600-second token behind a
   * longer timer authenticates at boot and never again, and the resulting 401 is indistinguishable
   * from the dependency being down. A market approved eleven minutes after a bootstrap would sit in
   * `awaiting_funds` forever with nothing in any log naming the cause.
   *
   * The fix is `micro-ledger`'s, unchanged: `@cloudsforge/auth`'s `ServiceTokenProvider` exchanges
   * this credential at `POST /service-tokens/exchange`, caches, re-mints at ~80% of `expiresIn` with
   * per-token jitter, shares one in-flight exchange, and on a 401 discards exactly the rejected
   * token and replays once. `src/upstreams.ts` carries the argument; this field is the input.
   *
   * **Not `requiredSecret`, for ledger's reason and one of our own.** `migrator.ts` shares this
   * environment and `foresight-migrate` is given no credential — it dials nothing. And the estate's
   * deploy does not set this variable yet (it sets the token), so making it mandatory would refuse
   * to boot a service that is currently running. The absence is not silent: `index.ts` says so at
   * boot at `fatal`, and `foresight_service_token_usable` is 0 on every scrape.
