/**
 * The custodial stake: a bettor who brought BTC, and the ledger entry that is their position.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **A CUSTODIAL STAKE IS A LEDGER ENTRY, NOT A SIGNING CAPABILITY.**
 *
 * `custody/src/gates.ts` lists the purposes custody will sign for — `deployer`, `treasury`,
 * `deposit` — and `user` is deliberately not among them. Nothing here asks for that to change. The
 * platform stakes the converted EMBER on chain from its OWN published address, exactly as the
 * house seed already does (`houseseed.ts`, and the argument at its head), and the user's share of
 * that aggregate position lives in `custodial_stakes` plus two ledger entries.
 *
 * **What that costs the user, said plainly rather than buried.** A self-custody stake survives
 * this platform being switched off: the EMBER is theirs in the contract and `claim()` reads
 * nothing but the contract's storage. A custodial stake does not — the aggregate in the contract
 * belongs to the platform address, and the user's share exists only in the ledger. That is what
 * "custodial" already means everywhere else in the estate, it is the only shape in which a BTC
 * holder can bet at all, and `stakeDisclosure` puts it on the screen where the user chooses.
 *
 * ── THE FOUR STATES, AND WHERE THE MONEY IS IN EACH ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   accepted   The user's stake asset has moved from `available` to `escrow`. It is still THEIRS.
 *              Nothing is on chain yet. A market that closes now refunds them, whole, in the asset
 *              they staked, in the amount they staked.
 *   staked     The platform has put `pool_amount` EMBER into the contract and the mirror shows it.
 *   settled    The market resolved. The escrowed asset became the platform's — it paid for the
 *              EMBER — and a winner's EMBER payout has been credited to them.
 *   refunded   The stake was never put on chain and the escrow was returned intact.
 *
 * ── WHAT THE PLATFORM IS AND IS NOT EXPOSED TO ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * On a stake the platform gives `pool_amount` EMBER and takes `stake_amount` BTC; whatever the
 * market does afterwards, both of those numbers are fixed. So the platform carries the FX from the
 * instant of the stake and carries NO exposure to the outcome — the outcome is settled entirely
 * inside the contract, between stakers. That is the position it can honestly disclose, and it is
 * the reason a payout is not converted back automatically: doing that at settlement time would
 * hand the platform the reverse leg on every winner at once, in the same direction, which is an
 * unhedged book against its own users.

 *      divide, and each winner takes back exactly what they put in.
 *   3. **The division does not come out whole.** `share = pool_i * losers / winners` floors, so
