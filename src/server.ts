/**
 * The HTTP surface.
 *
 * Rule 4 of docs/ecosystem/03 §2: `/livez`, `/readyz` and `/metrics` on every service, or it does
 * not pass CI.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **THERE IS NO ROUTE HERE THAT MOVES MONEY, HOLDS MONEY, OR COULD.**
 *
 * A stake goes wallet → contract. What this service offers is `POST /markets/:id/stake-intent`,
 * which answers with the contract address, the calldata and the policy verdict — everything a
 * wallet needs to build a transaction it will sign itself. The EMBER never comes near this process,
 * and there is no code path by which it could: nothing here has a key.
 *
 * `POST /markets/:id/deploy` and `/resolve` answer **202** with a status URL and reach no chain.
 * `micro-mint`'s rule, for its reason: a rolling deploy kills a request mid-flight, and the bad
 * landing is between a broadcast and the write that records it. A 202 is not a nicety — it is the
 * only shape in which the work can survive the process that started it.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The one decision that is easy to get backwards is the auth-fault mapping. A bad token is 401. A
 * verifier that could not reach the JWKS is **503**, never 401 — answering 401 there signs every
 * user in the estate out because identity is having a bad minute.

     *
     * `foresight-web/src/lib/foresight.ts` opens with the two defects this estate has actually
     * shipped, both of one kind — a client written against a surface somebody imagined rather than
     * the one the service registers. `micro-wallet` called `POST /v1/quotes` at a service that
     * serves `/rates`; `micro-market` called a `/v1` path at a service with no `/v1` routes at all,
     * and every listing 403'd. A browser that derived `https://studio.<apex>` from its own hostname
     * would be the third: `studio` has no row in the `@cloudsforge/ui` surfaces registry, so there
     * is no registry answer to derive FROM, and the guess would be a hostname nobody has published.
     *
     * The deployment knows its own studio address because it was configured with it. So it says so,
     * once, here, and the client reads it. `studioUrl` is null when `STUDIO_PUBLIC_URL` is unset —
     * which is a real answer ("this deployment cannot serve images from here") that a client can
     * render as a sentence, rather than a broken upload control.
     *
     * Unauthenticated because everything in it is public by construction: a hostname meant to be
     * typed into a browser, a path published in studio's own API, and a list of media types.

     * resolves, here, to "an operator may", and every one of these routes uses the SAME
     * `requireAdmin` + `operatorOf` pair every other mutating route uses. Inventing a per-market
     * owner column so that this feature could have its own notion of ownership would be a second
     * authority model in a service that has one, and a second model is one that will disagree with
     * the first.
