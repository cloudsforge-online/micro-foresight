/**
 * Resolution: checking the named source, and posting the answer on chain.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **A MARKET WHOSE NAMED SOURCE IS GONE AT RESOLUTION IS VOID.**
 *
 * 19-new-products.md §2.3.5, and it is the rule that costs something, which is how you know it is
 * doing work. The tempting alternative is always available and always available in good faith: the
 * exchange this market named has shut down, but here is another exchange with the same figure, and
 * everyone can see what the answer obviously is. Taking it once makes the criteria advisory, and
 * criteria that are advisory are criteria the operator chooses after the fact — which is precisely
 * the thing a stranger staking money has no way to check.
 *
 * So: source unreachable at resolution → `void`, refund, whole, no fee. The market cost the
 * platform its fee and cost the bettors nothing, and that asymmetry is the point. It gives the
 * operator a standing incentive to name sources that will still be there.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * ## How the oracle posts, and why it looks strange
 *
 * The oracle key is held by `micro-custody`, whose EVM policy for a `deployer`-purpose address
 * permits exactly one shape: a zero-value contract CREATION (`custody/src/signing.ts:210-231`).
 * There is no purpose in custody today that signs a contract call — `transfer` requires empty
 * calldata and says in terms that widening it would turn the key into a signing oracle
 * (`custody/src/signing.ts:239-245`), `SIGNABLE_PURPOSES` is three names (`custody/src/gates.ts:35`),
 * and `custody_keys_purpose_ck` will not store a fourth (`custody/src/migrations.ts:117`).
 *
 * So the resolution IS a contract creation: a `ForesightResolver` whose constructor calls
 * `oracleAct` and which then deploys with no runtime code at all. The market checks
 * `msg.sender == createAddress(oracle, nonce)` for a nonce the resolver supplies, which is exactly
 * as strong as `msg.sender == oracle` — only the oracle account can ever produce a contract at that
 * address. Nothing about custody changed, no new signing path exists, and the key still cannot move
 * a wei.
 *
 * ## The chain-keyed lease, and why it is coarse here
 *
 * Every market on a chain resolves through ONE oracle address, so the contended resource genuinely
 * is that address's nonce. This is `micro-settlement`'s case exactly, and the key is
 * `oracle:<chain>:<network>` with `resolutions_in_flight_uniq` behind it. Two workers past a skewed
 * lease would read one nonce, obtain two signatures, and one of the two resolutions would be lost
 * with a market's winners waiting on it.

/**
 * The operator-visible half of a resolution.
 *
 * TWO DEFECTS IN ONE LINE OF CODE. `GET /markets/:id/resolution` used to return the `Resolution`
 * row verbatim, and:
 *
 *   1. **It 500'd from the moment the oracle signed.** `oracleNonce` is a `bigint`, `send()`
 *      serialises with `JSON.stringify` (`server.ts:944`), and JSON.stringify THROWS on a bigint
 *      rather than coercing it. So the route worked for exactly as long as the resolution had not
 *      been signed — which is to say, it failed on every call an operator would actually make,
 *      while its tests (which never covered the route) stayed green.
 *   2. **It exposed the signing path.** `rawTx`, `oracleAddress`, `resolverAddress` and
 *      `custodyAuditId` are how the resolution gets signed and broadcast; an operator console
 *      needs to know a resolution's STATE, never its transaction bytes.
 *
 * Narrowing fixes both at once, which is why it is one function rather than a serialiser patch: a
 * bigint replacer bolted onto `send()` would have fixed the 500 and left the exposure, and would
 * have quietly permitted bigints on every other route, where this estate's convention is that an
 * amount crosses as a decimal string chosen deliberately, not coerced by a global.
 *
 * Found by micro-foresight-admin-web, the first client to call the route.
