/**
 * Custody, as this service uses it.
 *
 * **This service holds no keys and asks for none.** It sends unsigned contract creations and
 * receives bytes. There is no method here that could return key material even if custody offered
 * one, and custody has exactly one route that returns any — the export ceremony's redemption —
 * which needs a user token and cannot be reached with the credential below.
 *
 * Routes verified against `micro-custody/src/server.ts`: `POST /v1/addresses` at line 320 and
 * `POST /v1/sign` at line 424. Both are `/v1`-prefixed; custody is one of the two services in the
 * estate that prefixes (the other is settlement), and writing a client against the unprefixed form
 * would produce a 404 that reads like a custody outage.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * ONE PURPOSE, ONE SHAPE, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE OF THE BLAST RADIUS — AND ALSO THE WHOLE OF THE
 * CONSTRAINT THIS SERVICE HAD TO DESIGN AROUND.
 *
 * Every signature this service asks for is `purpose: 'deployer'`, which custody's policy binds to
 * the `creation` shape: `to` must be null, `value` must be zero, `data` must be non-empty creation
 * bytecode under EIP-3860's 49,152-byte ceiling, and the gas limit must lie in [21,000, 8,000,000]
 * (`custody/src/signing.ts:210-231`). A deployer address therefore CANNOT transfer, cannot call a
 * contract and cannot mint, whoever holds the credential.
 *
 * **There is no purpose in custody today whose EVM shape is "call a contract".** `SIGNABLE_PURPOSES`
 * is `{deployer, treasury, deposit}` (`custody/src/gates.ts:35`); `transfer` requires empty
 * calldata and says in terms that widening it would turn the key into a signing oracle
 * (`custody/src/signing.ts:239-245`); and `custody_keys_purpose_ck` (`custody/src/migrations.ts:117`)
 * will not even store a fourth purpose. That refusal is right and it is not this repository's to
 * overturn — so the ORACLE acts by creating a contract too. See `ForesightMarket._isOracle` for how
 * the market recognises it, and `resolve.ts` for the mechanics.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * ## The binding is restated, and that is the awkward part of this interface
 *
 * `POST /v1/sign` takes SEVEN identity fields — `address`, `chain`, `network`, `family`, `purpose`,
 * `userId`, `orderId` — and compares all seven, character for character, against the row it holds
 * (`custody/src/gates.ts:120-137`). Getting any one of them wrong is a 403 `binding_mismatch` whose
 * message deliberately does NOT say which field disagreed, because naming it would be an oracle a
 * caller could walk one field at a time. So a caller cannot debug a mismatch from the response; it
 * has to be right by construction instead.
 *
 * **The one field that is not this service's slug is `chain`.** Custody's names are
 * `ethereum`/`bitcoin`/`solana`/`xrp`/`ember`; Hearth is `ember` in both vocabularies, which is why
 * `custodyChainOf` in `chains.ts` is a named table with one entry rather than a `toLowerCase()` —
 * the table is what makes the next chain a one-line addition instead of a silent 403.
