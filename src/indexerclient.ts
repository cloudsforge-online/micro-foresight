/**
 * The indexer, as the position mirror uses it.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THIS IS THE ONLY WAY THIS SERVICE LEARNS WHAT IS IN A POOL, AND IT IS DELIBERATELY INDIRECT.
 *
 * foresight could read the chain itself. It does not, for the reason `micro-wallet` does not
 * either: reorg handling is genuinely hard, `micro-indexer` has already solved it once with a
 * checkpoint, a canonical/orphaned distinction and a block-atomic write, and a second
 * implementation of that is a second set of the same bugs. What the indexer publishes is what this
 * service believes.
 *
 * The consequence is stated on every page that shows a pool: the mirror is **as of** a block, and
 * it can be behind. `mirror_cursors.synced_at` is what the page shows, and a stale mirror is a
 * degraded read, never a wrong one.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * ## Routes, verified against `micro-indexer/src/server.ts`
 *
 *   `POST /v1/watch/:chain/:network/:address`               line 321 — 202, idempotent
 *   `GET  /v1/addresses/:chain/:network/:address/activity`  line 318 — the paged value-transfer view
 *   `GET  /v1/transactions/:chain/:network/:hash`           line 319 — carries `logs`
 *   `GET  /v1/chains/:chain/:network/status`                line 317 — the tip, for `asOf`
 *
 * Both the `/v1` and unprefixed forms are served (`indexer/src/server.ts:124`), and `/v1` is the
 * estate convention and the one used here.
 *
 * ## Why the mirror needs two calls per transaction
 *
 * `activity` reports value transfers in and out of a watched address, which is exactly the shape of
 * a stake — wallet → market contract — and carries the reorg status this whole design turns on. It
 * does not carry the OUTCOME the staker backed, because that lives in the `Staked` log's data. So
 * the mirror pages activity to find candidate transactions and reads each one's logs to decode
 * them. The alternative — a log-query endpoint on the indexer — does not exist, and adding one is a
 * change to a repository this task may not touch.
