# Build context is this repository, plus two named contexts for the unpublished sibling packages:
#
#   docker build -t foresight \
#     --build-context runtimepkgs=../runtime \
#     --build-context contractspkgs=../contracts .
#
# Both extra contexts are temporary. Once the @cloudsforge/* packages are published (AD-02),
# package.json takes registry versions, the COPY lines marked below are deleted, the flags go away,
# and this becomes an ordinary single-context build. Nothing else changes.
#
# They are named `runtimepkgs`/`contractspkgs` rather than `runtime`/`contracts` because a build
# context and a build stage share one namespace, and the final stage below is called `runtime`.

# Pin pnpm in the image. The sibling workspaces are installed before this service's own
# package.json is copied, so corepack has no packageManager field to read at that point and would
# otherwise grab whatever is latest and then refuse to switch to the 11.9.0 the siblings pin.

# Temporary: the `link:` dependencies resolve to ../runtime and ../contracts relative to this
# directory, so the packages must exist at those paths inside the image for the lockfile to stay
# frozen. `link:` in particular resolves at install time to the sibling's own node_modules, which is
# why each context carries its packages' manifests as well as their sources.

# Install the siblings' OWN dependencies first. `link:` uses the sibling as-is and does not manage
# its dependency tree, so /runtime's and /contracts' node_modules must exist independently — both
# for `tsc` to resolve the sibling source it typechecks (jose, @opentelemetry/api,
# @cloudsforge/contracts-chain) and for `node --import tsx` to load @cloudsforge/* at run time.
# Without this the image builds a set of @cloudsforge symlinks that point at source which cannot
# resolve its own imports.

# build instead of the first request.

# `seed/` is here for the TYPECHECK and not for the image. `src/seedquestions.test.ts` imports
# `seed/questions-2026h2.mjs` to validate it against the allowlist, so without this line `tsc`
# stops at TS2307 and the image build fails on a file the running service never reads — the seed
# questions are input to the estate's bootstrap seeder, not to this process. It is deliberately not
# copied into the runtime stage below, for the same reason.

# No corepack, no pnpm, no build toolchain in the final image: fewer things an RCE can reach, and
# nothing at runtime needs them. In particular NO `solc` — the contract bytecode this service
# deploys is the COMMITTED artefact `src/contracts/generated.ts`, which CI recompiles and diffs. A
# compiler in the image would be a second source of bytecode, and the whole point of committing it
# is that there is only one.
#
# The siblings come across too: /app/node_modules holds @cloudsforge/* as symlinks into them, so
# without the targets the links dangle and the first `import '@cloudsforge/db'` fails at run time.

# The migrator is a SEPARATE one-shot process — `node --import tsx src/migrator.ts` — run as an init
# container or a Kubernetes Job before this ever starts. It is deliberately not invoked here: below
# SCHEMA_VERSION the `markets_unapproved_never_opens` CHECK and the `positions_source_uniq` index
# may not exist, and those are the two lines that make "a machine's proposal opened a market" and
# "a reorg doubled the pool" impossible rather than merely unlikely. A service that could create
# them at boot is a service that could start without them. `index.ts` asserts the schema version and
# refuses to serve below it.
